# THEORETICAL EVALUATION OF TMDCs AS PHOTOSENSITIZERS


This repository gathers the theoretical background, computational workflows, scripts, and data for a master's project on transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) as photosensitizers. The aim is to assess their optical properties, excited state features, and charge-transfer characteristics to determine their utility in photochemical and photovoltaic applications.

**Keywords:** TMDC, transition metal dichalcogenides, photosensitizer, DFT, TD-DFT, GW-BSE, exciton, optical absorption, spin–orbit coupling, charge transfer

## Goals

- Understand the impact of TMDC structure and composition on their photophysical properties.
- Develop and validate computational models for key TMDCs (MoS₂, WS₂, MoSe₂, WSe₂).
- Quantify band gaps, absorption spectra, and excitonic features using first-principles methods (DFT, GW-BSE, TD-DFT).
- Assess charge-transfer alignment and excited state lifetimes for practical photosensitizer scenarios.


## Repository Content

- README.md — this file (project overview and instructions).
- Work_Schedule/ — project planning and schedule documents (milestones, timelines, Gantt charts, weekly plans). Add spreadsheets, PDFs, or text files describing the work plan.
- presentation_sujet/ — presentation materials and subject description (slides, PDF handouts, speaker notes, images, and related assets).
